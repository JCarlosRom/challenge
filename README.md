 ### Questions
* What would you do differently if you had more time? Maybe work with promises, accommodate functions in other files, create test of performance
* What is the runtime complexity of each function? Its low because I work with storage into the server, and the function aren't not so complex
* How does your code work? With routes and controllers and express, I created an API 
* What other approaches did you decide not to pursue? Use node modules that are not required
* How would you test this? With a software of consume of apis like Postman and a library of testing like mocha
